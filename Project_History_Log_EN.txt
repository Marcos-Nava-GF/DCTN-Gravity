# Gractal Lab Diary (Project History Log)

This document records the evolution of the "Dynamic Causal Tensor Networks (DCTN)" project in clear, accessible language, designed to trace the history of our theoretical and technical modifications.

## ✅ Change History (Past)

### [Jan-22-2026] - Semantic Refactoring: From Black Holes to "Saturated Hubs"
**What changed?**
We changed how we name objects in the universe to be more precise.
- **Before**: We used "Tensor Hub" only for black holes.
- **Now**: 
    - **Tensor Hub (Dense Node)**: Any massive object (a planet, a star, a galaxy). It's simply a zone where the network has many links.
    - **Saturated Hub**: The new name for Black Holes. It is a "Tensor Hub" that has reached the maximum possible information limit (Bekenstein Limit). It cannot store more data, which is why it becomes "saturated".
**Why?** To differentiate normal physics (stars) from extreme physics (black holes) within the same theoretical framework.

### [Jan-22-2026] - Hubble Tension Solution (Preprint 02 v1.1.0)
**What changed?**
We introduced a formula to explain why the universe seems to expand at different speeds.
- **Formula**: `Actual_Expansion = Initial_Expansion + Gractal_Impulse` ($E_a = E_i + \alpha_a$).
- **Key Finding**: We discovered that adding a **2.5%** impulse to the original expansion makes the data match almost perfectly.
- **Validation**: We verified that with this adjustment, the age of the universe is **13.75 billion years**, which is correct because it is older than the oldest known star (Methuselah).

### [Jan-22-2026] - Migration to LaTeX (Professionalization)
**What changed?**
We stopped using basic text files (Markdown) for papers and switched to **LaTeX**, the global scientific standard.
- Documents now have real academic formatting, with properly drawn mathematical equations and formal bibliography.
- We renamed files to be more descriptive (e.g., from `01_Espacio_Tiempo` to `01_Dynamic_Causal_Tensor_Networks`).

### [Jan-22-2026] - Generation of Graphic Evidence (Simulations)
**What did we do?**
Since we didn't have the original simulation images, we created programs (scripts) to regenerate them from scratch based on the theory's mathematics.
- We created maps of what the network looks like (Graphs).
- We generated the chart demonstrating how the Hubble problem is resolved.
- We visually simulated a Black Hole (Saturated Hub).

### [Inception] - Project Start
**What did we do?**
We established the `Gractal_Labs` folder structure and defined the "Gractal Trilogy":
1.  **Foundations**: What is space made of? (Tensor Networks).
2.  **Cosmology**: How does the universe grow? (Thermodynamics).
3.  **Phenomenology**: What happens at the extremes? (Black Holes).
