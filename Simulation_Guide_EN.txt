# Gractal Simulation Guide

This file explains what each Python simulator does and which Preprint (Paper) it connects to. All scripts are located in the `External_Assets` or `Simulations` folder.

## 🧪 Simulation 1: Topology & Phase Transition
**File**: `generate_transition_figs.py` and `gractal_generation.py`
**Linked to**: 📄 **Preprint 01: Dynamic Causal Tensor Networks**
...
## 🧪 Simulation 2a: Hubble Tension Calibration (1D)
**File**: `Simulations/Hubble_Tension/hubble_tension_calibration.py`
...
## 🧪 Simulation 2b: Density Dynamics (1D Curve)
**File**: `Simulations/Hubble_Tension/hubble_tension_density.py`
**Linked to**: 📄 **Preprint 02 (Napkin Logic)**

### What does it do?
Simulates the equation `Ea = Ei * (1 + alpha/rho^x)`. Graphically shows how expansion is faster in voids.

## 🧪 Simulation 2c: Gractal N-Body Cosmology (3D)
**File**: `Simulations/Hubble_Tension/gractal_nbody_simulation.py`
**Linked to**: 📄 **Preprint 02**

### What does it do?
Generates a "Toy Universe" in 3D with 2000 nodes distributed fractally ($d_H \approx 1.41$).
1.  Calculates the actual density of each point in 3D space.
2.  Applies the "Napkin Logic" to each particle.
3.  **Result**: A 3D map (`p2_fig3_nbody_expansion.png`) where empty filaments glow with high expansion (red) and dense clusters remain stable (blue).
4.  Generates raw data in `gractal_simulation_data.csv`.
