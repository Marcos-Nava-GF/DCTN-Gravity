### A Discrete Framework for Emergent Spacetime and Quantum Gravity

**Author:** Marcos Fernando Nava Salazar

## Overview
This repository contains the simulation code and LaTeX source files for the DCTN Trilogy, a theoretical framework proposing that spacetime emerges from a network of causal tensors evolving under thermodynamic constraints.

## The Trilogy

### 1. Foundations
Defines the **Gractal Topology**. Demonstrates how a smooth Minkowski metric ($K \approx 0$) emerges from a discrete graph at the critical point $\alpha_c \approx 2.5$.
* Key Result: Spectral Dimension flow $d_s: 1.25 \to 4$.

### 2. Cosmology (Hubble Tension)
Resolves the **Hubble Tension** by applying Landauer's Principle to cosmic expansion.
* Key Result: Predicts $H_0 \approx 94$ km/s/Mpc in voids vs $67$ km/s/Mpc in clusters due to information processing efficiency ($\delta$ calibration).

### 3. Phenomenology
Models **Black Holes** as "Tensor Hubs" of saturated information, avoiding singularities.
* Key Result: Hawking Temperature derivation from network entropy and Lorentz Violation scale prediction at $E \approx 10^{19}$ GeV.

## Reproducibility
To run the simulations:
```bash
python simulations/gractal_generation.py
