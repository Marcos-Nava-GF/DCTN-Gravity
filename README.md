# Gractal Labs - Dynamic Causal Tensor Networks (DCTN)

Welcome to the official repository of the **Gractal Theory**. This project explores a new framework for Quantum Gravity where spacetime emerges from a discrete network of causal tensors.

> **About Gractal Labs:**
> Gractal Labs is an independent research, simulation, and development environment founded and maintained by **Marcos Fernando Nava Salazar**. It is dedicated to exploring the intersection of graph theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and quantum gravity through high-performance numerical simulations and theoretical derivation.

## 📐 The Master Equation of Emergence

Based on the $N=100,000$ simulation run, we have derived a unified scaling law for the fine-structure constant:

$$ \alpha_{DCTN} = d_H \cdot \frac{\alpha_{local}}{N^{d_s}} $$

Where:
* **$d_H \approx 1.41$**: Hausdorff Dimension (Space Density).
* **$d_s \approx 1.25$**: Spectral Dimension (Information Dilution).
* **$\alpha_{local} \approx 9309$**: Raw Topological Charge (Strong Force regime).
* **$N$**: Universe Scale (Nodes).

**Experimental Validation:**
Using the simulation data:
$$ \alpha_{DCTN} = 1.41 \times \frac{9309}{100000^{1.25}} \approx 0.00738 $$
Compared to the standard model:
$$ \alpha_{QED} \approx \frac{1}{137.036} \approx 0.00729 $$
**Relative Error:** $\approx 1.1\%$
